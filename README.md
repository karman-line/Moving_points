# Moving_points

While analyzing school playground area sizes in Bangalore, I found that 1000 m^2 of playground, roughly the size of two basketball courts, is the playing space available for around 385 children in the city. Using a graphical simulation, I intend on demonstrating the lack of space that 385 points has in that area.
